            <h2>NineRoot Digital Research: PAXos</h2>
            <img src="../images/paxlogo2-1.png" alt="Article Image 1">
            <p>We have now launched a special program called NineRoot Digital Research. In this program, we will analyze
                information technology for our advanced developments. The first development will be the PAX
                (Latin for "World") operating system. Now we are actively developing the kernel of the operating system
                itself.</p>
            <p>The PAX OS (PAX Operating System by NineRoot Systems) project includes the development of the kernel, the
                graphical shell (interface) and the PAX AI. Why is our operating system unique? Our operating
                system will be fast, and optimized - which means it will unleash the potential of your computer to the
                max. A beautiful design and adaptive interface will be able to give you the freedom to do what you want.
                Adaptive interface that you can change by yourself, without any code or any assembly, you can easily
                graphically change the interface to unrecognizable.
                Optimization for developers: switch easily to developer mode, for adaptive and smart operation of your
                OS. Easy integration with Linux terminal and Windows cmd. And also our exclusive terminal - ContServ,
                for easy parsing of your information by letters, boxes and finally containers.
            </p>
            <p>The innovation of PAXos is to make a lightweight and beautiful operating system. Windows is not very user
                friendly, due to its closed code. Linux is contradictory, sometimes not convenient, not stable (there is
                no chance that some of the drivers will not fall off) and it is difficult for beginners. And there is no
                normal amount of software available on it because of Open Source. As we know, Microsoft is going to
                transfer everyone to Windows 11 - an extremely unstable version of the OS Windows. By the way, they are
                introducing a useless assistant Copilot (I guess the experience of Cortana did not teach them). Now many
                people are “obsessed” with AI. And that's cool, it would be nice to concentrate this AI power in the
                right direction, instead of releasing raw boring products.
                My OS will not have a separate assistant. My OS will be that assistant. That's my optimization, cut the
                kernel code. Literally, the AI will complement the kernel. There will be a machine rebellion! (kidding).

            <p>The next part of the study: the PAXDesk. A special research paper dedicated to the renovation of modern
                nettops and laptops. The essence is simple, to stop cutting down the components for laptops, and due to
                high performance and built-in gadgets (keyboard, touchpad, battery, screen) to make a convenient
                portable PC. Also, such a PC will be compatible with Windows, Linux, EasyBCD and the future PAXos. </p>

            <p>Laptops are often overpriced and underpowered. A $1,000 gaming laptop usually offers performance
                equivalent to a $400 desktop. Why? Let’s explore:
                Problems with Laptops:

                Weakened Components: Laptop parts are downsized for portability, like compact GPUs replacing full-sized
                PC graphics cards. This sacrifices performance, cooling, and durability.

                Overheating: Laptops can hit 92°C, causing thermal throttling (slowing down to prevent damage), frequent
                freezes, and loud fan noise. High temperatures can also make the laptop uncomfortable to use.

                Battery Dependency: Gaming laptops rely heavily on being plugged in. Without charging, performance drops
                significantly, and battery life is typically around two hours—negating portability.

                Poor Airflow Design: Components are crammed into the bottom, requiring flat, hard surfaces for proper
                cooling. This design heats up the keyboard area, sometimes to an uncomfortable level.

                Proposed Solutions:

                Redesign Airflow: Place components on the top cover for better ventilation and cooling efficiency.

                Use Standard Components: Equip laptops with desktop-grade hardware like Mini-ITX motherboards and
                full-sized GPUs. Use vertical GPU placement and external power supplies to save space.

                Eliminate Batteries: Without a revolutionary new battery, laptops could skip internal power sources
                entirely for better performance and cooling.

                These changes could create powerful, desk-friendly laptops that rival desktops without the typical
                drawbacks.
